in a mystical enchanted forest
on the bustling streets of a cyberpunk city
inside a grand, forgotten throne room
on the bridge of a derelict starship
beneath a bioluminescent coral reef
in a cozy, cluttered library filled with ancient tomes
on a windswept volcanic plain under a stormy sky
at a vibrant, neon-lit night market in Tokyo
inside a vast, crystalline cave
on a floating island in the sky
in a post-apocalyptic wasteland
within a serene, meticulously kept zen garden
